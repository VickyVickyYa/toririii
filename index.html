  <em>Birds in South America</em>
    
    <p> Birds occupy a wide array of habitats, ranging from forests and grasslands to aquatic environments and even human-modified landscapes. A bird's habitat provides essential resources like food, water, nesting sites, and protection from predators, influencing where different species are found and how they thrive. </p>
